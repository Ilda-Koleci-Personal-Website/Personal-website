                "Balance is not better time management, but better boundary management. Balance means making choices and enjoying those choices.
                Here are 2 things that help me keep the work-life balance:<br>
                <p>1. Spending quality time with my family,especially with my husband and our son.</p><br>

                <p>
                    2.Photograpy. A great benefit of photography as a hobby is that it can help improve your physical and mental health. As mentioned above, taking photos can be a great way to relax and unwind in an otherwise stressful world. 
                    It also gives you the opportunity to get out and explore new places, which can provide much-needed exercise.</p><br>
